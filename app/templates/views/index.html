        Emergency Alerts is a UK government system that provides warning and advice in a life nearby.

        The government will be running a national test of the Emergency Alerts system on Sunday 7 September 2025.

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Reasons you might get an&nbsp;alert</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        You may get alerts about any type of life threatening emergency, such as:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          wildfires
        </li>

        There are simple and effective steps you can take to be more prepared for an emergency in your area.
        Visit <a class="govuk-link" href="gov.uk/prepare">gov.uk/prepare</a> for more information.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Emergency alerts will only be sent by:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          the emergency services
        </li>
        <li>
          government departments, agencies and public bodies that deal with emergencies
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What happens when you get an emergency alert</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Your mobile phone or tablet may:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          make a loud siren-like sound, even if it’s set on silent
        </li>
        <li>
          vibrate
        </li>
        <li>
          read out the alert
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        The sound and vibration will last for about 10 seconds.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        An alert will include a phone number or a link to the GOV.UK website for more information.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        You’ll get alerts based on your current location - not where you live or work. You do not need to turn on location services to receive alerts.
      </p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What you need to do</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        When you get an alert, stop what you’re doing and follow the instructions in the alert.
      </p>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">If you’re driving or riding when you get an alert</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Do not read or respond to an emergency alert while driving or riding.
      <p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Find somewhere safe and legal to stop before reading the message. If there’s nowhere safe and legal to stop, and nobody else is in the vehicle to read the alert, you can listen to news on live radio to find out about the emergency.
      </p>
      <div class="govuk-inset-text">
        It’s illegal to use a hand-held device while driving or riding.
      </div>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">If you cannot receive emergency alerts</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        If you do not have a <a class="govuk-link" href="/alerts/how-alerts-work#compatible-devices">compatible device</a>, you’ll still be informed about an emergency. The emergency services have other ways to warn you when there is a threat to life.
      </p>
      <div class="govuk-inset-text">
        Emergency alerts will not replace local news, radio, television or social media.
      </div>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">If you’re deaf, hard of hearing, blind or partially sighted</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        If you have a vision or hearing impairment, audio and vibration attention signals will let you know you have an emergency alert if accessibility notifications have been enabled on your mobile phone or tablet.
      </p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Alert languages</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Emergency alerts will be sent in English. In Wales, they may also be sent in Welsh.
